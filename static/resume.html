		<p>Hi, my name is Robert M. Koch, though I'm often called Rob. I am a thirty-something scientist and developer at home in beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado. I count myself among adelphoi. I can be reached via the 717 area code, at number 7610 of exchange 686, or also at <a href="mailto:threadmetal@gmail.com">threadmetal@gmail.com</a> if you prefer email.</p>
		<p>I was born and raised in Pennsylvania, where I was introduced to computer programming at eight years of age. After voraciously self-educating for two decades, I sought professional help -- and graduated from Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania with separate degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics.</p>
		<p>Colleagues and educational faculty have commented on my drive for improvement and education. I've been told by friends that as much as I think, still I feel even more; as obvious as it is that I have a lot coming from my mind, I have even more coming from my heart. This was not always so ; this was a goal.</p>
		<p>My past work has focused on signal processing, pattern recognition, machine learning, and data warehousing; my areas of active research are (a) a secure and trustworthy socially networked <a id="change-manager" href="#nowhere" class="covert action">change management</a> system for software and (b) counterbalancing the impact of the use of addictive technologies in video games and advertisements.</p>
		<p>When I'm not geeking out, I'm walking or playing guitar. I like activities that put me in touch with the order and chaos in reality. I like activities that make me think, and activities that let me learn. I like to hike; I like to scout new paths.</p>

		<h3>Education</h3>
      <h4>Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania</h4>
      <h5>B.S. Computer Science | B.S. Mathematics</h5>
		<p>Since my general education requirements were nearly completed before I arrived at Shippensburg, I had plenty of time to plan the education of my dreams and nightmares. You can see <a href="shippensburg.html">a summary <span class="only-screen">here</span><span class="only-print">online</span></a> of independent or unusually ambitious projects and accomplishments achieved during my stay at Ship. Thanks are owed to the faculty, who supported my curiosity during in-major courses worth two degrees and nearly four full concentrations.</p>
		<p class="only-screen">I had much fun, learned many things, and didn't care a whit about my GPA or what my paperwork would look like when I was finished. I was not present to get a degree, but rather to get an education. I explicitly succeeded in this ambition, and I attribute this to the fact that a passion for personal and professional development will take care of your education for you, but no amount of formal education will give you a passion for personal and professional development -- and there is always more to learn. The process of education is never, and should never, be over.</p>
