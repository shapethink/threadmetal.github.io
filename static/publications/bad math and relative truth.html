		<p>absolute truth understood relatively well</p>
	<hr />
		<div><p>I recently stumbled across a blog called "Good Math / Bad Math" (link below), and one of the reader-supplied comments I saw posted there included a notion that I've heard repeated many ways, by many people -- and it's become a growing concern to me:</p>
		<blockquote>As musicians know music is one. i would say the same about math. Math is one. There is no bad math as there is no bad music</blockquote>
		<p>I've been hearing a disturbing amount of this type of thinking, including among people I consider well-educated. It is often framed and discussed under a concept that "all truth is relative" -- but <b>I believe this sentiment is hurtful to rational thought and discussion. I'd like to take a fair amount of time to explain why</b>, using the "math is one" concept, and also the number "one" itself, as my focii.</p>
		<p>I see no particular issue with presuming that "[all] math is one [thing]", but I do take issue with the conclusion that therefore "there is no bad math". My complaint is its dependency on a "No True Scotsman" fallacy -- namely, it asserts that "bad math" doesn't exist, a true statement if and only if "bad math" isn't considered "math". For example, let me pretend to assert that the additive identity in a ring is not unique. That is an incorrect statement, and <b>if one calls a false statement "math" one must also call it "bad math".</b> For the other side of the coin, pause right now and attempt to give yourself a rigorous definition for "bad music", or "bad art". Like so many English words, there simply isn't one rigorous definition; Webster's (along with every other dictionary ever) is a completely made-up document, after all.</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, <b>people using "bad math" can just as accurately be said to be using "something that is not math", and then calling it "math"</b> -- and then the debate becomes about ignorance, deception, and intent. So, instead, I'll side with the blog author, and allow them to call something "math" without calling them a "liar" -- even if it's not "true math".</p>
		<p>Hence the notational choice of <b>calling something "bad math" allows us to factor out such ethical/psychological issues, and address the quality and veracity of something which may appear, on the surface, to be "math"</b> -- much as we might analyze certain properties of a "sound" by allowing it to be called "music", regardless of whether it adheres to any particular "musical" constraint or aesthetic, then also we have the option of ignoring aesthetics and analyzing which constraints it meets or fails to meet.</p>
		<p>Unlike art, which is arguably about inducing a purely subjective truth in a recipient; and unlike science, which is about identifying a purely objective truth given necessarily flawed measurements and sensory input; <b>mathematics is about purely objective truth, in structure, from start to finish</b> -- without possibility of incorrectness. <b>The potential for incorrectness</b> exists, but just like in science, it <b>comes from flawed reasoning, not flawed truth.</b></p>
		<p>In both science and mathematics, <b>everything begins with "IF".</b> In science, a nicely generalized version reads: "IF we have tolerably measured these quantities", even though (for example) our ruler might only measure 1mm increments. In mathematics, you can often generalize to: "IF we are dealing with a...", referring to a concept which has an already known, already defined, already specified structure; for example, "one half", "(exactly) 0.5", and "1/2" are three representations of one concept, which is a fraction (ratio) of two whole (natural) numbers. These are concepts already objectively defined and objectively decidable; <b>any concept you might conceive is either consistent with the definition of a rational number; or it is not; and the truth of this decision, yes or no, won't ever change -- no relativism involved.</b> In both science and mathematics, the IF is often left off during early education. This is.. sad, but understandable, given for example the ratio of teachers to students.</p>
		<p>I think that for many people, the illusion that "all truth is relative" arises because we constantly see examples where either science or mathematics -- both of which are aimed at identifying universal truths, albeit from opposite directions -- are often misapplied. For a trivial example, <b>predicting where you will end up if you drive for one minute depends far less on how precise your ruler is, compared to predicting where you'll end up if you drive for one year.</b> This difference is a factor of more than 525,000; that is, more than a half million. If you were off by a millimeter for one minute, you'd be off by more than half a kilometer for the year -- but few people would consider computing the error bounds for this question at all.</p>
		<p>Some noise adds up, some noise cancels out, but <b>in any physical measurement, there is noise, and eventually that noise can matter enough to break your predictions.</b> In both math and science, <b>the assumption is that your inputs were valid -- and the truth is that IF they were not, the prediction given by math/science is also not valid</b> -- even though your prediction may still be "correct by accident", it is a "correctness" that neither math nor science ever offered to you. When you ignore the "IF" part of science and math, <b>getting lucky -- or failing to get lucky -- has nothing to do with truth.</b></p>
		<p>However, IF your inputs are valid, your predictions will be valid no matter how bad your "luck" is: <b>reality will present the assumed response if you test the effect of true assumptions.</b> For science, "validity" often depends on things like having "tolerable error" or "measurements within tolerance". I can see a certain degree of "relativity of truth" there; an especially good example would be when making three predictions, one based on classical mechanics, one based on relativistic mechanics, one based on quantum mechanics -- each with their own circumstancial definitions of "tolerance" and "tolerable". Yes, here I can see a solid source of confusion about the relativism of truth itself, when the "IF" of your assumptions is supposed to be baked into every analysis, yet <b>in many areas of philosophical interest, examining the fact or error of those assumptions is defeated by the reality that, in some cases, we can't even directly observe some of the "tolerances" involved.</b></p>
		<p><b>For mathematics</b> -- and this is where I get my tensors in a twist -- <b>that noise is absent</b>, and there is no such problem. The "IF" is <b>purely structural</b> in nature. <b>You have</b> either satisfied the "IF" by definition, or <b>you must</b> satisfy the "IF" by proof, or <b>else you cannot</b> rely on that math <b>for that input</b>. And yet -- people constantly do, because we usually aren't taught to think of "math" as a science of patterns of structures of concepts -- we're usually taught to think of it in terms of numbers, functions, geometric shapes -- with little or no basis given for understanding the nature and structure of these tools. <b>We are taught that the number matters more than the shape; that the boiled-down answer is more valid and more useful than exploration of the question. This seems patently false to me.</b> Particularly, we seem to most strongly be taught that the geometric shape of our letter grade depends on a function of the number of test/homework questions we failed to answer correctly -- and that "the grade" is more important than <b>which</b> questions we got wrong and <b>why</b>.</p>
		<p>That education.... really has nothing to do with math. I mean, ignorance of the shape in favor of the number, prioritizing the answer over the question -- even though it's true math, I still consider that "bad math". It's this sort of education which I believe leads so strongly to the delusion that *ALL* truth is relative. Yes, IF you abandon the consequential thinking of that critical "IF", well THEN all truth is relative, much as all velocity is relative to some observer, but <b>if you live in this reality, there are some truths that are fixed and inviolable -- in that they are "relative" to concepts that are fixed and inviolable in this reality.</b> A different reality, perhaps, would violate the "inviolable concept" of that "IF" -- and so it is, in an important way, a "relative" truth that two lines are either parallel or intersect at exactly one point, because I can examine concepts of "space" and "distance" which are otherwise perfectly normal, but violate that property.</p>
		<p>However, no reality admits a contradiction. Any imagined universe which admits a contradiction -- within itself and by its own laws -- cannot be a reality; such a universe cannot exist. Since we may assume we live in a reality, this gives us some limited information about its nature, as compared to other universes we may imagine.</b></p>
		<p>Unfortunately, this limited unscientific information is not very useful for our technologies of convenience or comfort. However, <b>I believe this understanding to be critical for our empowerment and sanity as a culture -- even as a species.</b></p>
		<p><b>We must accept that relative truth exists; but also that some truth is absolute. We must accept that absolute truth exists; and also that some truth is relative. We must practice respect for the objective truth, especially in front of children -- who at birth know only the subjective truth "I want", and the objective truth "I am".</b></p>
		<p><b>We must accept that no writing or speech can relieve us of the responsibility to rise out of ignorance; we must attempt to align our subjective "truth" with the ideal of objective reality -- wherever we may be mistaken -- or else we will be condemned to a haphazard and delusional existence, and inflict it on our children -- possibly even the species at large.</b></p>
		<p><b>We must accept that no writing or speech can relieve us of the responsibility to rise out of apathy; we must attempt to align the objective "reality" with our idealized subjective truth -- wherever we may truly act to make it so -- or else we will be condemned to a hateful and miserable existence, and inflict it on our children -- possibly even the species at large.</b></p>
		<p>It is true that this is an opinionated prescription, and that the information it contains is not derived from science; science can go only as far as its evidence permits -- but let me give clear evidence that math is not so fettered: <b>there exists no universe nor reality where the number I am attempting to represent as "1" is not equal to the number I am attempting to represent as "one".</b></p>
		<p>To give you a trivial example of another absolute truth -- just to help you establish that such a thing exists -- wrap your brain around this related situation: Take "the number one"; cut it into ten pieces, leave nine and take the last one aside. Cut that into ten peices, put nine with the other pieces you left, and take the last one aside... repeat, <b>literally</b> forever.</p>
		<p>This is a computational construction of the number 0.99999999... and <b>it never halts; that is to say, the "number" you're "building" is never complete.</b> At any part of the process, there is some part of the "one" left over which you have yet to subdivide. But, <b>it's important to note that "progress" is not an "answer".</b></p>
		<p>The truth of the notions involved is that the "number" concept represented by the label "one" is the same, equivalent, identical, beyond any possibility of distinction or difference, EQUAL TO the "number" concept represented by "0.99999....", where<b> the nines literally don't stop -- even though you can't really write it down that way</b>. Let me repeat this: some of <b>the confusion here arises through an abuse of notation.</b></p>
		<p>This the most common "debate" I encounter where <b>"relativism of truth"</b> often gets invoked -- where it <b>usually acts as a mechanism for shutting down the conversation.</b> The problem here is that it isn't a debate; it is objectively and completely true that, IF you are talking about "numbers" in the same sense as you were taught -- the "numbers" you're familiar with such as 0, 1, 1/2, even numbers like (pi + 6i) -- THEN (0.999... = 1).</p>
		<p>Completely. <b>Unequivocally -- without equal voice.</b> That is to say, this is an example of a very rare and dangerous-to-mistake situation: it lacks merit to provide an equal treatment to the "opposing point of view". The moment you think you've found a proof otherwise, you have in fact found a different concept of "number", which is not the same as the concept being discussed. Treating it as the same discussion is deceptive; at the very least it is self-deceptive.</p>
		<p>For example, consider the fact that the "computational approach" above never reaches its "goal" of one. <b>Attempting to use that in a proof about the "goal" requires you to accept a false premise</b>, the concept that "the value of a number depends on how you built the number". This is NOT true -- not in arithmetic, nor in physics, nor in observable daily life. In math, the value of a "number" is independent of how it was "computed"; in physics, the potential energy stored in a charged capacitor doesn't depend on how the charge got there. <b>Even on the streets of a city, you are not at a different address simply because you took a different route.</b></p>
		<p>Now, there ARE universes where these things matter -- in fact, there is a math over the space of computational processes that admits *many* distinctions between any possible attempt to finitely represent "one" vs any possible attempt to "Compute ALL the nines!!". That math exists, and has many structural truths that can be proven, including the truth that those two computational structures are inequal.</p>
		<p>But at that point, we're no longer discussing "one", or "1", or "0.9999..." -- properly, we're suggesting two kinds of programs, call them A and B, such that A computes "1" and B computes "0.9999....", and <b>it can be shown that A != B. This is NOT the same thing as showing that the *results* of these programs are inequal</b>; in fact, many forms of analysis end up asserting that B doesn't properly HAVE a result, as such -- but for any analysis which admits a result for B, that *result*, in the *numerical* context originally discussed -- is *exactly equal* to one; it is *identifiable* with one; the difference (result(A) - result(B)) is precisely that number zero, which, when added to any (x) yields (x); it is not an infinitesimal, like you may have heard "dx" treated in calculus. It is not an ill-formed number; <b>although (0.999...) could be considered an ill-formed *representation* of a number (as would then also be 0.333...) -- still the number being *represented* would in truth be "one", "1", "the multiplicative identity".</b></p>
		<p><b>That truth is not a relative truth.</b> It is <i>*always*</i> true, <b>IF</b> -- yes, I said that correctly. That <b>IF</b> is never broken without breaking the question itself -- that is, by poor communication and/or failures of education. Therefore, to consider the number represented by "0.99999...." as something different from the number represented by "one" -- that would be "bad math", or "not math" -- or put simply, "false".</p>
		<p><b>So, IF you consider all truth to be relative, THEN you are deceived.</b></p>
