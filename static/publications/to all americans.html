		<h1>to all americans</h1>
		<p>a call for preconservative ideals</p>
	<hr />
	<div>
		<p>
			Eventually, in any discussion of politics, I hear beliefs similar to mine being described as "quixotic": <i>exceedingly idealistic; unrealistic and impractical</i>. I submit that those sharing my views are nothing, <i><b>nothing</b></i> like Don Quixote. I submit the possibility that the vast majority of contemporary political posturing is not based on any reach for ideals, has nothing to do with anything that has ever made America great, and is no more useful than "tilting at windmills". I submit that ideals gave birth to this nation -- not the self-righteous claiming of ideals; not even, at first, the pursuit of ideals -- rather, the rejection of a Crown which had too little consideration for ideals beyond the selfish interests of that crown.</p>
		<p>
			So, if you tell me to put down my ideals and play politics, I tell you truthfully that I will not. I would rather be citizen to a nation of donkey-riding windmill-chasers than to a nation shaped by the same forces rejected at its founding; in fact, I suggest that by rejecting those forces of short-sighted self-interest we <i>defined the very notion of American patriotism at its birth</i>. I am proudly American; I am in awe of the staggering opportunity for greatness we possess; once through sheer idealistic patriotism, now through sheer historical and geographic circumstance; a form of greatness that takes no steam nor status from the greatness of others; a form of greatness that no force save apathy can take away from us.</p>
		<p>
			I am simply not proud of the "america" we have created together these last generations: one whose societal ideal is no more ideal than that of the history whose "yoke" it threw off; sick with lingering self-importance and fear of collapse; fear of the loss of greatness we have already lost through our fear. We are a nation no longer united, but torn and divided: Red vs Blue, 99% vs 1%, citizen vs citizen in a manner personal and vicious, unheard of even as we fought over the <i>ideals</i> surrounding states' rights and slavery. To what ideals do we attribute our division now?</p>
		<p>
			As of this moment, we quite soundly prove day by day that terrorism <b>is in fact</b> an effective means for influencing the evolution of a society. Please, <i>do not continue this way</i>. This nation is not a brand name, whose value will plummet in some hypothetical stock market of <i>statii quo</i> if so much as a whiff of brand-disloyalty is smelled. I reject the "crown" stamped with that brand name, and wholly reject the blind worship it demands -- blind nationalism such as is seen historically in those we have labelled enemies -- blind and self-righteous pride so insidious that entire nations fall under its yoke.</p>
		<p>
			Time and time again throughout history those claiming the name "American" have willingly spent their lives and blood to guarantee their own national liberty in the face of such a virulent blindness -- but these threats come no longer from without, from some nation-state with dreams of empire, some evil agent of tyranny and despotism -- today we are threatened by the tyrrany of ignorance and despotism of apathy -- our own.</p>
		<p>
			Ignorance is a natural state, into which we are all born, and from which we all may rise in an "ideal" society: one with ambition for improvement and development; one that continually reaches for ideals, laughing all the way at what it knows to be an inevitable gap between "ideals dreamed" and "realities achieved"; yet still reaching! It may easily be called a course predestined for failure, if perfection and ideals are considered "all or nothing" -- yet the price of such "failure" is not pride, but ignorance; its wages are wisdom, not shame. Do you judge it a waste to sweep floors, cut grass, or mend windows? In time all such tasks leave no trace save for their impact on lives, perhaps not even your own. Unable to reach perfection, nor keep it should it fleetingly be stumbled upon, should we then never reach toward it? That is a question whose answer is found in the mandate of greatness; it is a question whose answer is found in the mandate of apathy; and they are opposed.</p>
		<p>
			Even though we might have some clues, some clear and well understood psychological underpinnings for our apathy; even though it is possible we already understand its reasons; still there is no excuse even in the presence of a reason -- and no precedent in history for such magnitude of social apathy as we now possess -- and it may yet leave us damned in the eyes of our own children's children, who will all, without exception and without recourse, fall under the yoke of such an insidious and well-intentioned descent into apathy as we find ourselves aimed toward.</p>
		<p>
			Such a yoke, through generations, will render our society closer and closer to one in which "ignorance" is considered a bad word, rather than a natural state; one in which I'm okay, and you're okay, and any group of us together is okay -- but nothing is any longer great; and no group may claim loudly, without ostracism, that there exists a problem: that there are ideals worth approaching, even at the cost of pride; that a need for self-improvement and societal improvement are not symptoms of failure; that the driving, aching desire for such improvement is not a symptom of malcontent, but a symptom of our heritage; a rightful reach for greatness such as every single soul on this earth <b>may and by rights ought</b> to attempt... but no; no such group will exist unscathed. So long as apathy sits enthroned, ideals are mocked as windmills; altruism is denounced as self-interested; greatness in others is dismissed as pathetic, or else jealously suppressed.</p>
		<p>
			I reject this future, and I ask of you who claim the name "American" to be a human being; not a vote. Be a citizen; not an <i>American(tm)</i> -- because "America" is not a brand name, and I wouldn't buy today's version of that brand if it were. Instead, I tell you that "American" is a word that can yet be reclaimed as the "hopelessly idealistic" compliment it once hoped to be.</p>
		<p>
			Be the 100%! These states may be united, but these people are not! Find your ideal, your dream, your ambition for a great America; and discuss loudly and freely the possibilities of achieving it, or at the least approaching it; not at the expense of all those other ambitions of all those other people around you, some of whom seem frivolous, some of whom scare you and seem to threaten your ideals; even your very way of life! No, not even in the face of such perceived threats should you be the citizen seeking to stifle those they disagree with, else you are the rightful and dangerous source of that fear in others!</p>
		<p>
			Live by <i>your own</i> principles of heroism; stop and think! <i>Know</i> them, know <i>yourself</i>, and determine for yourself what it means, to yourself, to be a hero: <b>you</b>, the hero! Live by principles of heroism which <i>you</i> know, to your <i>core</i>, to be heroic according to your own ideals; not because it is a code claimed by any other, <i>not even</i> those claimed by your most popular idol. Although others, even those of obvious greatness, may share the ideals which motivate you, that motivation must yet be yours and no other's; the responsibility is yours and only yours to understand what role you are here to inflict upon this world.</p>
		<p>
			Do not be a machine following programming, unmoderated by critical thinking; this is something I think you will understand, and recognize that our nation has struggled against this in others; we should have a care not to leave the disease untreated in ourselves. You might already know that the nightly television lineup is called "programming" (for unrelated reasons) -- and it is only one example, and a conveniently labelled one at that. I argue for you to treat all programming as such, and seek to identify where your programming is coming from; I argue for you to treat it with the respect and skepticism it deserves. It is a valuable source of information, not of knowledge -- a valuable source of opinions, not of morals -- and certainly not an infallible source for your own beliefs, though it is a valuable source for understanding <i>some</i> of the beliefs of <i>some</i> of the people in <i>some</i> of the world.</p>
		<p>
			We are are a nation made for more than this; in fact, across borders, <i>we are a species made for more than this</i>. You are made to argue and explore, question and learn, teach others and above all correct <i>your own</i> misconceptions, starting first with the first folly: that you are free of folly.</p>
		<p>
			Find those who disagree with you and talk with them! Seek to find a way to implement your ideals in a manner that empowers others to achieve their own, rather than seeking to suppress them. Ideals are so rarely mutually exclusive, and yet we are so sadly wired to perceive anything "other" as "antagonist" -- yet here, at least, we are a nation that proclaims each and every citizen a protagonist! We seem to have much to do to live up to our imaginations, and no part of it is aided by apathy.</p>
		<p>
			I tell you, it is nowhere near too late; it is worth many times the price we must pay; in fact, we should count ourselves thankful that there is no blood price for escaping the tyranny of our own psychology. The price is time; convenience; possibly even reputation. These are things just like currency; they are not commodities, they are not ends in themselves, nor even means to an end -- <i>they are no more than a means to a means</i>. You are not bound by the programming which seems to dictate that we, as a culture, treat those worthless-in-themselves concepts as something worth more than the ends we may idealistically spend them toward.</p>
		<p>
			So, yes, ultimately, the message is simple: get out of your rut, clean yourself off, then loudly and publicly start risking -- no, in fact I say start spending -- that precious reputation. Do it to improve lives, not merely the lives of you and yours, but also the lives of others. Wherever you can, consider the impact on the <b>100%</b> -- it might not require you to spend anything that isn't already supposed to be free in this country.</p>
		<p>
			Then, I will be happy to call you American -- even if I disagree with you and consider your ideals a threat to my own -- because I would prefer to treat you as I would wish to be treated, and I would wish to be called an American with enthusiasm and approval, instead of being called American from the simple apathetic obligation of the longitude and latitude of my birth.</p>
		<p>
			If you merely "sieze the day", how will you recognize the day? Sieze any day. Sieze today. Still better, sieze a year. Welcome to the stage. I don't know your lines, but I'm looking forward to them.. have fun!</p>
