		<p><strong>this is an experimental draft completely subject to change</strong></p>
		<h3>how i work</h3>
		<h5>first let's talk</h5>
		<p>Basically, we talk often, for fifteen minutes at a time. I spend up to 45 minutes documenting the discussion, then if you like send the analysis to you for your review. Also, if you suggest, I will await your approval before continuing. I do not consider this hour labor, as it serves me more than you. I then apply up to three hours of documented labor directly to the purposes defined by our discussions, and up to one hour documenting the result and the work. Things get done, and we also get to know how and why.</p>
		<p>Now, before we go any further, let me emphasize two things: (a) I am deliberately attempting to value my time at some fraction of yours, take that as you will; and (b) that this is a tool, not a requirement. It is, naturally, not the right tool for all situations. We may prefer to use a different format as the situation calls. One reason I use this tool is its power to manage changing or unknown requirements.</p>
		<p>The purpose of this structured communication exercise is to obtain up to four well-communicated, testable expectations for the next discussion. Discussions are scheduled two in advance, so the time-frame for the expectations is known ahead of time.</p>
		<ul>
			<li >The first five minutes are intended for a swift review of what's changed compared to what we expected to have changed.</li>
			<li>Five more are devoted to you to have us use as you see fit.</li>
			<li>The last five minutes are sometimes hectic, and play somewhat like a game:
			<ul>
				<li>recall the duration until the next discussion</li>
				<li>up to one minute is intended for deciding on each expectation and refining it into a usable state</li>
				<li>the remainder, at least one minute, is intended to:
				<ul>
					<li>recall the time of the next discussion</li>
					<li>review the success of this discussion (out of 10 points)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>up to four points for completed expectations</li>
						<li>up to four points for created expectations</li>
						<li>one point at your disposal to indicate your mood on how long things have taken</li>
						<li>one point at your disposal to indicate your mood on how well things have been done</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>confirm that we have reached consensus and commit to the expectations</li>
				</ul></li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul>
		<p>I expect a need for depth or detail will sometimes make longer discussions quite useful. Some things just need saying personally, but for anything else you might wish, please send me <a href="mailto:threadmetal@gmail.com">an email</a> with any sources you'd like me to examine before the discussion, so I can help make good value of our time.</p>

		<p>My wage is your gratitude. That's right, you are not required to pay. Please indulge your conscience. If you can't hear your conscience, please don't pay me, but consider paying it forward.</p>
	<hr />
		<p>If you prefer, I can volunteer to help for free.</p>
		<p>I only help face to face, so you must be present, and willing to either teach or learn. You will perform the work of the task where I cannot share it - but you will get more than you pay for :-)</p>
		<p>Alone, I can work on site or remotely as workspace and time permit. Expect competetive pricing, but do not expect competitive timetables, as all work will be documented and published. You still will get more than you pay for, if you wish. :-)</p>
		<p>I approve of try-before-you-buy, and if you feel wary feel free to lurk before you try - you'll get to see what I mean. If what you see here interests you, please <a href="resume.html">contact me</a>.</p>
