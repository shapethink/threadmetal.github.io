		<h5>first let's talk</h5>
		<p>I talk with you for fifteen minutes at a time.</p>
		<p>The purpose of the exercise is to obtain up to four well-communicated testable expectations for the next discussion, which will have already been scheduled before this discussion began.</p>
		<ul>
			<li >The first five minutes are intended for a swift review of what's changed compared to what we expected to have changed.</li>
			<li>Five more are devoted to you to have us use as you see fit.</li>
			<li>The last five minutes are sometimes hectic, and play somewhat like a game:
			<ul>
				<li>up to one minute is intended for deciding on each expectation and refining it into a usable state</li>
				<li>the remainder, at least one minute, is intended to:
				<ul>
					<li>recall the time of the next discussion</li>
					<li>review the success of this discussion (out of 10 points)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>up to four points for completed expectations</li>
						<li>up to four points for created expectations</li>
						<li>one point at your disposal to indicate your mood on how long things have taken</li>
						<li>one point at your disposal to indicate your mood on how well things have been done</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>confirm that we have reached consensus and commit to the next discussion</li>
				</ul></li>
			</ul></li>

		<p>My wage is your gratitude. That's right, you are not required to pay. Please indulge your conscience. If you can't hear your conscience, please don't pay me.</p>

		<p>Fifteen minutes of improving my resume could save you four hours of labor, or if you prefer you can have help for free.</p>
		<p>I only help face to face, so you must be present, and willing to either teach or learn. You will perform the work of the task where I cannot share it - but you will get more than you pay for :-)</p>
		<p>Alone, I can work on site or remotely as workspace and time permit. Expect competetive pricing, but do not expect competitive timetables, as all work will be documented and published. You still will get more than you pay for, if you wish. :-)</p>
		<p>I approve of try-before-you-buy, and if you feel wary feel free to lurk before you try - you'll get to see what I mean. If what you see here interests you, please <a href="resume.html">contact me</a>.</p>
